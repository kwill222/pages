<h2>Preference in Web Hosting Service</h2>
<p>Personally, I prefer using the CSIS serving for storing my html files. 
  The reason I have this opinion is because using the CSIS server is a very simple way of storing files I may need 
  access to from anywhere at anytime. In order to create and save a file, all I need to do is create an html file in 
  Notepad++, connect to the CSIS server, and upload it. If I need to edit the document away from school, all I need to do 
  it type in the CSIS address, including my username, and the name of the program. From there, I can just copy and paste the 
  code into an editor and edit it as needed. Very simple concept, and very easy to use.</p>
